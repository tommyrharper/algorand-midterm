**CONCLUSION**

In this section we are going to discuss a few overall observations regarding Algorand's protocol.

**1. How do the cryptographic elements, the economic incentives and the blockchain parameters all contribute to the core goals of this blockchain?**

The 4 core goals of Algorand are environmental sustainability, scalability, decentralisation, security and transaction speed.

**1.1. Environmental sustainability**

Achieved via the use of Proof of Stake rather than a Proof of Work consensus mechanism, as this allows Algorand to ope         rate with the use of minimal computing power. This means the network can reach a large scale without consuming excess energy.


**1.2. Scalability and transaction speed** 

Achieved through a number of mechanisms. Compact certificates are used to convince verifiers that a group of signers with sufficient total weight in terms of staked algo have signed a block without the verifier having to see or verify all the signatures. This leads to signatures 50-250x smaller and 300-4000x cheaper to verify than a standard approach, helping the Algorand blockchain to scale furiously as blocks are able to be verified at a faster rate. Another great feature of Algorand that helps to ensure fast transaction speeds is immediate finality, which is possible due to Algorands forkless nature.


Furthermore the threshold for committee lottery can be dynamically adapted to adjust committee size, ensuring it is small enough to keep communication overhead low so that blocks can continue to be produced at a stupendous rate as the blockchain scales.

**1.3. Decentralisation and security** 

Cryptographic Sortition and VRFs (Variable Random Functions) as part of their consensus algorithm. This allows a random block proposer and committee to be chosen for any given block, even in spite of the presence of a powerful adversary who is able to corrupt any ⅓ of the stake weighted users in the system instantly at any given time and fully coordinate and control them. This is possible as the block proposer to only reveal their identity at the same time they propose the block. This means a given powerful attacker would not be able to corrupt the block proposer until after they had already shared the block, at which point it will be gossiped and validated by the ⅔ of honest users.

One way Algorand attempts to ensure decentralisation is via the uses of virtually zero barrier to entry for users wanting to participate in the staking consensus mechanism, unlike many other blockchains, where it is necessary to either run your own node and/or meet a certain minimum financial requirement and/or lockup period in order to participate in the staking process. Only 1 algo is needed (currently about $0.35) is needed to participate. This economically incentivises a large user base to participate in the algorands consensus mechanism ensuring further decentralisation of the network.

**1.2. Upsides**

Probably the single best feature in Algorand is the forkless nature of the blockchain which allows immediate finality of transactions as soon as they are included within a block.

Another quality we really liked about Algorand is that it has a low financial barrier to entry, both in terms of very low transaction costs and the ability to participate in the staking process with as little as 1 algo.

**1.3. Downside**

One of our least favourite things about Algorand is how they manage governance. In the current state of the network, Algorand’s solution to governance gives the illusion of decentralisation and brings little utility and fairness to the user. The Algorand Foundation controls the incoming proposals and regardless of the choice of the people, gets the final say off-chain. Algorand also incentivises voting through the reward of tokens to the voter. The addition of this incentive has a large impact on the game of voting. Veering the reason to vote away from the function of the vote may have adverse effects.

Our second major issue is token allocation. Algorand Inc control around as of 25/07/22 around 50% of the total token supply, giving them enough stake to attack the network. In essence Algorand is in this sense, a highly centralised organisation that has the full power to control their blockchain, due to the fact that a malicious actor only needs control of 34% of tokens in the network.

**1.3. Attacking the network**

Algorand is highly vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to its low transaction fees and limited throughput of 1000 transactions per second. Burning 1 algo per second allows for an effective DDOS attack, blocking all transactions. At £0.29 per algo, that’s £1,044 per hour, or £25,056 per day, or £751,680 per month, effectively providing total DDOS for a reasonably affordable price.

Another vulnerability in the Algorand ecosystem is the smart contracts which are primarily written in Python. Hence it is likely that there could be vulnerabilities in the ecosystem, due to the highly flexible and permissive nature of Python code.
