**2. ECONOMICS**

**2.1 Tokenomics**

Algorand project has its own native cryptocurrency, called ALGO. At the genesis of the Algorand blockchain, 10Bn ALGO was minted. Algorand is inflationary, the tokens have been being distributed through different forms of ecosystem support and community incentives. As of March 31, 2022, the circulating supply was more than 6.7B ALGO, and the Foundation holds the remaining part in secure wallets with the following composition:

  
|ALLOCATION  |ALGO  |
|--|--|
| Community & Governance Rewards | 1757.26M |
|||
|Ecosystem Support|1176.05M|
|||
|Foundation Endowment|363M|

The token distribution has the purpose to incentivize the economic system built around the Algorand platform and to reward the participation to the Algorand Decentralized Governance and the contribution to the economic network activities.

For the initial period of Algorand's history, the distribution was based mainly on a number of different ecosystem programs, such as universities and grants, and on algorithmic rewards to the community, early backers, and network service providers. The main goal was decentralization and inflation control. In December 2020 the token distribution schedule was:

Since then, some of the main aspects have evolved:
-   The fixing of the circulating supply computation in September 2021 has aligned the definition of the circulating supply with the market standard with an increase of 1.6B Algo with no outflow.
    
-   The Algorithmic Vesting, with the feature of slowing down vesting while allowing accelerations based on market conditions, completed in October 2021. It has released 2.135B ALGO between the first significant acceleration in August 2020 and the completion of algorithmic vesting on October 6, 2021.
    
-   The remaining part of the Contingent Incentives has been allocated to fuel the ecosystem growth, which is now treated as a unique fund to strengthen economic and social activities.
   
**2.2 Transaction fees**

Transaction fees in Algorand are low. The minimum fee for a transaction is only 0.001 Algos.

**2.3 Staking**

Algorand uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) protocol built on Byzantine consensus. Each user’s influence on the choice of a new block is proportional to its stake in the system. The protocol does not make use of slashing to punish dishonest behavior.

Algorand had a staking rewards program that ended on May 14th, 2022. With this program, users could earn ALGO by participating in the Algorand network. All addresses that contained 1 ALGO or more received rewards, that were claimed every time a transaction occurred. The ALGO staking APY was between 5% and 6%. Currently, participation rewards have been fully distributed and completely replaced by governance rewards.

**2.4 Governance rewards**

The Algorand Community Governance program began in 2021, there are four quarterly governance periods per calendar year. Any Algorand address can commit to serving as a governor. In order to do so, you have to both pledge some of your ALGO to the program for a three-month period as well as vote in the growth and development of the Algorand ecosystem.

Once the three-month period is complete, governors are rewarded for their service by being allowed to claim governance rewards, which are sent to their Algorand address.

There is specific Rewards pool for each period, decided by Governance vote. For the first governance period (from October 2021 until the end of 2022 Q1), the rewards rate were:

In this graph, we can see the governance reward rate depends on the total quantity of ALGO committed for this period. Notice that for the first period the participation rewards are also included, as the staking rewards program was still active.

**2.5 Auctions**

The inaugural Algo auction was held on June 19, 2019, via a Dutch auction mechanism. A total of 25,000,000 ALGOs were sold at a clearing price of $2.40.

According to Algorand, they believe that the market should determine the price, and the Dutch auction was selected because it achieves this fairness for two main reasons:

-   At the auction, everyone who buys an ALGO buys it at the same price.
    
-   The market determines that price.
 
Specifically, this is how the ALGO auctions work and the price discovery method:

**2.5.1.  Duration, Supply and Price** 

A fixed amount of ALGOs is available for a fixed amount of time. During the auction, the price of the Algo starts at an initial price and continues to drop until it hits a reserve price, or all Algos for sale are sold at the auction’s clearing price.

**2.5.2.  Participants**

Users come in and bid during this auction by specifying how much money (in USD) they are willing to spend at that auction.

**2.5.3.  Arriving at a Fair Price**

As the price drops, users commit money, the number of ALGOs that are surely sold at the auction increases, and the number of remaining ALGOs drops.

**2.5.4.  Demand** 

The number of Algos demanded at any given time is given by

Because the amount of money committed never decreases and the price is always decreasing, the current demand increases with time (since prices drop, demand for ALGOs always increases with time).

 **2.5.5. Auction Finalisation** 

The auction ends when (a) current demand meets or exceeds supply or (b) the reserve price is met.

-   If current demand exceeds supply, then bids will be fulfilled on a first-come first-serve basis.
    
-   Upon auction completion, users can see how many Algos they received. Everyone who receives Algos will pay the same price per Algo, the “clearing price.”
