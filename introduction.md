Felix, Thomas, Giulia, Alex

2. What blockchain or blockchain project are you analyzing? Please insert a link to the original whitepaper.

[Algorand](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.01341.pdf)

3. What are the core offerings of this blockchain/project? 

Algorand provides a forkless, sustainable and scalable Pure Proof of Stake blockchain with provable/instant finality that can handle up to 1000 transactions per second.

1. What does it allow users to do?

Algorand provides a global transaction layer for fast transaction settlement. It can be used for  permissionless peer-to-peer financial interaction, the generation of staking rewards and the use of smart contracts written in Python via PyTEAL, which will compile down into TEAL. This allows the creation of dApps, NFTS and security tokens.

1. What is the differentiator for this project (what makes it unique from other blockchains or projects)?

Algorand has a few core differentiators. It is forkless, meaning finality is provided every 4.5 seconds, which is excellent for speedy transaction settlement. It also has very low transaction fees and a consensus mechanism which allows a limitless amount of nodes to participate in the staking process.
