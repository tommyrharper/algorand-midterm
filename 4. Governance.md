3. **GOVERNANCE**

##Â An Overview of the Collective Decision Making Process

Algorand has proposed to yield governors' decision-making power over the "Algorand Ecosystem Resource Pool" through a system of voting where a vote is directly proportional to the number of ALGO staked. The continuous participation in the voting sessions is required to receive rewards and for the vote to stay valid.
Anyone who holds an ALGO can directly participate in the voting thereby becoming a "governor".

## 3.1 Method of Voting

The voting system used is plurality, it's a system where the candidate with the most votes win regardless of absolute votes. Plurality is simple, easily understood by voters and streamlines the process although, it encourages an idea in tactical voting called "compromising", where a person votes for one of the few parties which are going to win, regardless of their true preferences. This is generally done so that their vote is represented at all.     

## Structure of Governance:

The structure of governance is a mix of vote delegation and direct democracy. It plans to incentivise voters through rewarding them with the native token ALGO. On the one hand this seems to in part solve the voting paradox by mitigating the cost of voting (which is not necessarily economic) simply by reimbursing the cost economically for their time and attention. I believe this is a mistake. The reason of voting should be only for the function the vote brings. It's value is the change it commits and perhaps nothing else. I imagine the incentives veering away from this idea, and with it, the quality of the network.             

## On the Utility and Legitimacy:

The utility and legitimacy of Algorand's governance system is questionable. The source of proposals unfortunately comes from the Algorand Foundation, an unelected commitee, not accessible by the many. It could even be said that this invokes the illusion of a democratic system under certain beliefs. It is representative of democracy in the UK, where only a member of parliament can introduce a bill. For good utility, we must trust that the Algorand Foundation is a benevolent group who does not act in self-interest. Furthermore, they must act as a representation for the heterogeneous collective, which in this case is practically impossible.

Furthermore, as I have said in the introduction, one ALGO is equal to one vote, therefore the people who have the real impact on the system (other than the foundation) are the rich. This clearly is a problem as companies, governments, or anyone with deep pockets can influence the system in a way that is not fair and, once again, does not represent the people's preferences. Quadratic voting is a solution to this however carries it's own challenge. A proof of personhood is required for this system to have any effect, as the work-around, the creation of multiple accounts, is easy and fast. 

Other than the standard of direct democracy, Algorand has implemented a partially complete version of vote delegation. This mechanism, for the time being, is only limited to delegating your vote straight back to the Algorand Foundation.
From my understanding the majority of people tend towards convenience, for example elevated prices at convenience stores are usually ignored. Alas, the foundation is incentivising people to vote on the future of the network through rewards and making it convenient to automatically send their votes straight back to the people making the proposals. Nice for the foundation... 
Algorand does have future plans to allow the delegation of votes to any participant who satisfies "precise objective requirements", which are not explained. This will come at the expense of a fixed fraction of the rewards for choosing a representative.

In the current state of the system, the execution of the governer's decisions is done off-chain by the Foundation! The decision, regardless of the votes given, is actually up to Algorand! Fortunately, "in the final system", they have stated to actually represent the decision made by governors on chain via a smart contract. Almost comedic.

## Conclusion

To conclude, there are many reasons to think that Algorand's governance system is efficient (for the foundation), centralised and unfair for the people. To improve this, the implementation of quadratic voting would make this system much fairer, and allowing the token holders to make proposals is also an important part of utility and legitimacy. Furthermore decisions must be implemented on chain via smart contracts as it stinks that Algorand have the final say. Algorand should take the power away from the foundation to be even be considered a legitimate chain in the eyes of the people. Perhaps this is not the role that Algorand are shooting for and unfortunatly to do this, they must take power away from themselves.

On the good side, it is a very practical system, simple and easy to use, and with 3 week voting periods, it is quick for a "democratic system". Their reward scheme for voting is a small step in an interesting directon that attempts to resolve the voting paradox and is a good place to start in the discussion.
