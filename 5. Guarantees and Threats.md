**4. BLOCKCHAIN GUARANTEES, THREAT MODELS AND SECURITY**

Algorand is a blockchain that comes with many promises regarding liveness, lack of forking, transactional speed and finality,  and offers both permissioned and permissionless application development tools. 

**4.1. Blockchain Guarantees** 

**4.1.1. Liveness and DOS attacks** 

That the blockchain is always adding more transactions and the service will not be interrupted.

Algorand governors/validators earn block rewards for authoring/confirming blocks, providing economic incentives to those who approve transactions. In theory, this should lead to a constant stream of finalised blocks. While the service is constant, averaging 1,000TPS with an average block time of 4.5 seconds[1], this constant stream of “mathematically forkless”[A] transactions also opens the door for attackers to spam the system with minimally sized transactions, at a rate of ~1,000TPS or greater, to effectively DoS the system for a price. 

It would only cost 21.6$ per minute to deliver a volume based DoS to the network, based upon an algo price of 0.35$ [2] and a transaction fee of 0.001 ALGO$ per transaction[3].

For MinTF = minimum transaction fee =  0.001Algo,
MaxTS = maximum transactions per second 1000, AlgoUSD = algo price in dollars 0.36USD, Algorand's cost permute can be calculated as follows:
	
	((MinTF * MaxTS) *  60s) * AlgoUSD = 
	((0.001 * 1000) * 60) * 0.36  =  21.6USD

**4.1.2. Fairness**

Fairness in this context can be defines as a "blockchain with no systemic discrimination that is against the rules of the protocol". Algorand uses a Proof-of-Stake model, and attempts to chose random users based upon stake to produce blocks. By the time a block producer is “revealed”, the block is already produced.[4] Whilst not “against the rules of the protocol”, Algorand offers systemic discrimination as a feature, such as Role Based Asset Control (RBAC).[5]

**4.1.3. Censorship-resistance**

Censorship-resistance can be defines in this context as "no individual actor or coalition can prevent the access of 	    	   another to the system".

Algorand offers censorship as part of its core technology offerings. While censorship-resistance is possiblem assuming that at least 2/3 of the nodes in the network are honest , it can be considered a bold assumption due to the fact the majority of the 		 $ALGO tokens were pre-mined and distributed to the centralised group Algorand, and continues to be distributed to that same group through a distribution schedule).[6] 

**4.1.4. Safety** 

Safety for blockchains mean that there is no conflicting information stored in finalised registers, for example there is no double-spending for any unit of currency.

Algorand protects against double-spend attacks by reaching consensus on an ordered log of transactions.  

 **4.2. Protection agains threats**
 
The main way Algorand protects against threats is by leveraging proof-of-stake to create the assumption that the majority of network participants are honest. 

**4.2.1. Byzantine Generals Problem**
With Algorands proof-of-stake consensus, it assumes that 66% or more of the network participants are honest. If 33% of the participants, or more specifically nodes were dishonest, a Byzantine attack becomes possible. 

**4.2.2. 51% attack**
Unlike the traditional proof-of-work that requires 51% of the hash power to commit an attack, with Algorands proof-of-stake only 33% of the node power is required to commit a similar attack. Algorand argues that the requirement to own $ALGO in order to commit such an attack, makes it safer, as you would have monetary losses for damaging “your own” network, as opposed to a miner attack, where the proof-of-work miners equipment has a much lower value correlation to the network. 

**4.2.3. Sybil Attacks** 
Due to the permission-less account structure, Algorand does not appear to be resistant to Sybil attacks, past transactional costs.

**4.3. Secure transactions**
By choosing block producers randomly and secretly, and by having a forkless network, all transactions are final and secure in Algorand.
